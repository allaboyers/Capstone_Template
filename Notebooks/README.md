### Notebook Descriptions
---

The notebooks are to be followed in the following order -

- **Step1_EDA_and_Baseline_Modelling.ipynb**

	In this notebook I aggregate data from multiple sources, explore the data to build an understanding, and prepare it for further analysis. I delve further into the data and perform detailed exploratory data analysis. I also build the baseline models.

- **Step2_Modelling.ipynb**

	
	In this final step, I build the advanced model using XGBoost model.
	I then look at the Classification Report, Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve.
